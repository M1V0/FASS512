    "text": "Step 2: Using R as a Calculator\nMost textbooks recommend familiarizing yourself with R and RStudio by first using R as a calculator. Let’s try this out.\nFor example, if you type 10 + 10 in the command prompt and press Return (Mac) / Return (Mac) / Enter (Windows), the result will be displayed underneath:\n\n10 + 10\n\n[1] 20\n\n\nPlease try out the following commands.\nIn the task below, just type the commands in the shaded area, then press Return (Mac) / Enter (Windows).\nNote: You don’t have the leave spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /, etc.), but the lines are more readable if you do.\nSo it’s better if you get used to writing 10 + 10 rather than 10+10, even though the output is the same.\nThe exception are negative values.\nHere, it is recommended not to leave a space between the minus sign - and the value we are negating. So, we would write -3, not - 3, even though it’s the same.\nPlease try out all of the commands on your computer now.\n\nThis is how we do addition\n\n\n10 + 10\n\n\nSubtraction\n\n\n8 - 2\n\n\nMultiplication\n\n\n10 * 14\n\n\nDivision\n\n\n112/8\n\n\nWe can also use exponents, i.e. raising a number to the power of another number, e.g., 2^8, as in the example below\n\n\n2 ^ 8\n\n\nSquare root. This is done via a function called sqrt(). We will discuss functions later. For now, just add a numerical value in the parentheses of sqrt()\n\n\nsqrt(64)\n\n\nYou can also combine +, -, *, /, ^ operators in your commands. By default, the precedence order of operations will be ^ followed by * or /, followed by + or -, just like in a calculator.\n\n\n2+3-4/2\n\nor\n\n3+9/3*2^8\n\n\nBut: You can use brackets () to overcome the default order to operations: Test the effect of bracketing on the precedence order of operations in the two examples below.\n\n\n#example a\n2 + 3 - 4 / 2\n\n#example b\n(2 + 3 - 4) / 2\n\nor\n\n#example a\n3 + 9 / 3 * 2 ^ 8\n\n#Example b\n(3 + 9) / 3 * 2 ^ 8"

This can save you a lot of time if you want to re- run one of the previous commands.\nGo ahead and rerun the last line using this method, but change the last number to a 4 (instead of an 8)\nIn the Environment, History, etc. pane, you can use the History tab to see your entire command history. If you click on any line in the History tab, it will re-run the command. Again, very helpful as it saves you a lot of typing.

This assigns everything that is to its right (the expression) to the variable on its left. Rather than typing &lt; and the minus sign, you can also simply press the shortcut Option+- (Mac) or Alt+- (Windows).\nName - The name is simply the name of the variable.\n\nrun the following\n\n\nx &lt;- 4 * 8\n\nIt appears that nothing happened; after all, there seems to be no output in the command prompt.

If you check the Environment tab in the Environment, History, Connections, etc. pane at the top right of your RStudio window, you will now see that new variable listed.\nOnce you have created a variable, you can use it for other calculations just like you would with any other number\n\n\n\n\nx * 36\n\nWe can also assign any of these values to new variables.\n\n\n\n\ny&lt;-x*28\n\ny"

    "title": "1. Introduction to quantitative research methods using R",
    "section": "Step 7: Data Types",
    "text": "Step 7: Data Types\nData types are variables that refer to collections of values. There are different types of data types (e.g., lists, matrices, arrays), but we will focus on two particularly important ones: vectors and data frames.\n\nVectors\nVectors are one-dimensional sequences of values. They are very simple but fundamental data structures, as you will see below when we talk about data frames. For this reason, it’s worth learning about vectors, how to create and manipulate them. Below we will cover numeric and character vectors.\nYou can create vectors by using the c() function. The c stands for combine. All the items within brackets, separated by commas, will be assigned to the variable on the left of the assignment operator.\nIf you type the following command, you will create a vector with seven elements. This is called a numeric vector as the elements within the brackets are numbers.\n\n\n\n\nnumbers &lt;- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17)\n\nWe can now use this vector to perform all kinds of operations. Try out the following, for example.\n\n\n\n\nnumbers + 1\n\nnumbers / 2\n\nnumbers^2\n\nNote how the operations are applied to each number in the vector.\nFor any vector (number sequence), we can also refer to individual numbers that form the vector. We do this by means of indexing operations []. For example, to get the first element of the vector, we can type the following. This will display the first element in the vector.\n\nnumbers[1]\n\nYou can also extract more than one element from the vector, and even specify the order. For example:\nNote the difference in the example above and the one below. Above, we just used [1] and that was fine, but because of how indexing works (and it gets more complex when handling different datatypes, such as 2-dimensional tables), we need to use the c() function to demonstrate what we are after.\n\nnumbers[c(4,2,1)]\n\nThis will retrieve the fourth element in the vector (the number 7), the first element (2) and the second (3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is it different?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if you don’t use the c() function? Try it out and see what happens.\n\nnumbers[4,2,1]\n\nError in numbers[4, 2, 1]: incorrect number of dimensions\n\n\nYou get an error! Now, in this particular situation, the error message isn’t the most helpful, but it is important to get familiar with errors (you will be seeing a lot of them in the next 10 weeks!), and note that they are useful. R cannot carry out operations that don’t make sense, and as it happens, the above command is telling it to look for the item in three dimensions (imagine a cube made of vectors). When we get errors it is useful to check our code to see what might be wrong.\n\n\n\nOr you can refer to consecutive set of elements in the vector, such as the fourth to the seventh elements. For this, simply type:\n\nnumbers[4:7]\n\nWe can also retrieve all elements with the exception of one. For this, we use the minus sign to exclude the vector element that we want to exclude, as in the following example.\n\nnumbers [-1]\n\nFinally, we can also exclude a sequence of elements by adding the minus sign before the c() function. This will exclude from the output all elements that are specified within the brackets.\n\nnumbers [-c(1, 3, 5, 7)]\n\nThe numbers vector is a sequence of numbers. We can find out the type of vector by using the function class(). This will confirm that numbers is a numeric vector.\n\nclass(numbers)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nthe class() command is really useful, and one worth remembering for future troubleshooting. Sometimes commands don’t run as you want them to, and checking the class is what you want is a great sanity check. It has saved me on many occasions.\n\n\n\nWe can also create vectors with elements that are character strings. Here, each element needs to be surrounded by quotation marks (single or double), as in the example below\n\ncolleges &lt;- c('bowland', 'cartmel', 'county', 'furness', 'fylde', 'graduate', 'grizedale', 'lonsdale', 'pendle')\n\ncolleges\n\nThis type of vector is character, how would you verify this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass(colleges)\n\n\n\n\nYou can index character vectors, just like numeric vectors.\n\ncolleges[3]\n\nBut you cannot perform arithmetic functions on character vectors, of course.\n\ncolleges*2\n\n\nCoercing vectors\nIn vectors, all of the elements must be of the same type. For example, you cannot have a vector that has both numbers and character strings as elements. If you try to create a vector with both numbers and character strings, then some of your elements will coerced into other types.\nIf you type the following, you will see that the attempt to create a mixed vector with character strings (bowland, cartmel, county, fylde) and numbers (1, 2, 5, 7, 8) converted the numbers into character strings, as evidenced by the quotation marks. You cannot perform calculations on these numbers as R interprets them as text strings.\n\nc('bowland', 'cartmel', 'county', 'furness', 'fylde', 1, 2, 5, 7, 8)\n\nFinally, you can also combine vectors using thec()function. For example, we can create a new vector called new_numbers by combining the original numbers vectors and adding the squares and cubes of numbers.\n\nnew_numbers &lt;- c(numbers, numbers ^ 2, numbers ^ 3)\n\nnew_numbers\n\nWe have now produced a new vector new_numbers with 21 elements. These don’t fit all in a line and so are wrapped over two lines. The first row displays elements 1 to 12, and the second row begins with element 13. Now you can also see the meaning of the [1] on the output. The [1] is just the index of the first element of the vector show on the corresponding line. [1] refers to the first element in our vector (the number 2), and [13] refers to the 13th element in our vector (169).\n\n\nNaming Vectors\nThe elements of a vector can be named, too. Each element in our vector can have a distinct label, which can be useful.\n\nages &lt;- c(bob = 27, bill = 34, charles = 76)\n\nages\n\nWe can now access the values of the vector by the label or by the index as before.\n\nages['bill']\n\nages[2]\n\nWe can also add names to existing vectors by using the names() function. In the following example, we first assign new values to the vector ages. This will delete the previous numbers and labels. We then assign names to this vector using the names() function.\n\nages &lt;- c(23, 54, 8)\nnames(ages) &lt;- c(\"michaela\", \"jane\", \"jacques\")\nages\n\n\n\nMissing Values\nLast but not least. Sometimes, we have missing values in our data. In R, missing values are denoted by NA. This is not treated as a character string but as a special symbol.\nYou can insert a placeholder for a missing value into a numeric or character vector by simply typing NA in the list of elements.\n\na&lt;-c(1,5,7,NA,11,14)\na\n\n\nb &lt;- c('michaela', 'bill', NA, 'jane')\nb\n\n\n\n\nDataframes\nData frames are probably the most important data structure in R. They are the default form for representing data sets for statistical analyses.\nData frames have a certain number of columns, and each column has the same number of rows. Each column is a vector, and so data frames are essentially collections of equal-length vectors. (This is also why we spent so much time on vectors above…)\nThere are two ways of creating data frames. We can create a data frame in R by importing a data file, usually in .csv or .xlsx format. (We will discuss how to import files next week.)\nOr we can use the data.frame() function to create a data frame from scratch, as in the following example.\n\ndata_df &lt;- data.frame(name = c('bill', 'jane', 'jacques'), age = c(23, 54, 8))\n\ndata_df\n\nAs you can see, we have now created a data frame with two columns (name, age) and three rows (displaying the name and age of each person, Bill, Jane and Jacques). The columns are our variables and the rows are our observations of these variables.\nWe can refer to specific elements of the data frame by using indices. In the example below, there are two elements within the index [ ], one for the rows, one for the columns. These are separated by a comma [ , ].\nFor example, to refer to the element that is in the second row, first column, you would type the following.\n\ndata_df[2 ,1]\n\nYou can also retrieve multiple elements. One way of doing this is by leaving one of the indices blank.\nIf you leave the first index blank (e.g., [ , 1]), then you are telling R that you want the information from all the rows. In the example below, you retrieve the information that is in all the rows that are in column 1.\n\ndata_df[ ,1]\n\nIn contrast, if you leave the second index blank ([2, ], you will retrieve the information found in the second row across the two columns.\n\ndata_df[2 , ]\n\nWe can also be more specific. For example, you can refer to the first and third row of the second column, we would type:\n\ndata_df[c(1, 3), 2]\n\nOn the other hand, we can also refer to a column by name. To do this, we need to use the $ notation.\n\ndata_df$name\n\ndata_df$age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you notice that RStudio will automatically suggest the variable names after you typed the $? The code completion feature in RStudio makes writing and executing code much easier!\nIt will do this for pretty much everything that is either a function, a variable, or even an argument (we come to those later), provided that you have typed at least three characters (or press Tab to get there faster)"

    "section": "Step 8: Functions",
    "text": "Step 8: Functions\nWhile data structures hold data in R, functions are used to do things with the data. You have already encountered a few functions above, namely sqrt(), c(), and data.frame().\nAcross all R packages and R’s standard library, there are tens of thousands of functions available for you to use. However, most of our analyses in this course will require only a relatively small number of functions.\nBelow is a general introduction to functions; we will cover functions in more detail as we progress through this course.\nFunctions tend to have the following structure:\nfunction(argument 1, argument 2, argument 3, ...)\nWe can think of functions as actions and arguments as the inputs, i.e. something the functions act on. Most functions require at least one argument. If they have more than one argument, these are separated by commas as in the example above.\nFor example, see what happens when you type the following two commands.\n\nsqrt()\nsqrt(4)\n\nThe function sqrt() requires an argument; if you fail to supply an argument you will get an error message (Error in sqrt()…)\nHere are another few functions that are helpful for our analyses.\nWe can count the number of elements in a given vector by using the length() function.\n\nlength(new_numbers)\n\nWe can calculate sum, mean, median, and standard deviation as follows. (More on this in future sessions when we discuss exploratory data analysis.)\n\nsum(new_numbers)\n\nmean(new_numbers)\n\nmedian(new_numbers)\n\nsd(new_numbers)\n\nYou can also nest functions inside each other, such as:\n\nround(sqrt(mean(new_numbers)))\n\nHere, we use three functions, each nested within the other. In the example, we first calculated the mean of the vector new_numbers (460.381), then the square root of this value and finally rounded it. We could have done the same calculation in three steps, as in the example below, but nesting the functions in a single command allows us to be more efficient.\nNow, I don’t like nesting functions and neither should you. Next session I will cover this more clearly, and introduce you to a set of functions and stylistic choices that are the gold standard in psychology and have a huge user base (meaning there’s plenty of help out there). For now, just be in awe of the complexity of carrying out multiple functions in R.\n\nOptional arguments\nIn some cases, functions can also take an additional argument. A good example is the mean() function, which can an additional argument called trim. If we add the trim argument to the mean function, the command will first remove a certain proportion of the extreme values of the vector and then calculate the mean. This is very useful when we are dealing with outliers in our data, for example. (We will talk more about outliers in future sessions.)\nIn order to trim observations, we need to specify a value between 0 to 0.5. This will trim the highest and the lowest values before calculating the mean. Naturally, a trim value of 0 means you’re not trimming anything, so the value assigned to trim should be greater than 0. For example, a value of 0.1 means you’re trimming the 10% highest and lowest observations, 0.2 means you’re trimming the 20% highest and lowest, and so forth.\n\nmean(new_numbers)\n\nmean(new_numbers, trim=0.0)\n\nmean(new_numbers, trim=0.1)\n\nmean(new_numbers, trim=0.2)\n\nmean(new_numbers, trim=0.3)\n\nmean(new_numbers, trim=0.4)\n\nmean(new_numbers, trim=0.5)"

This is useful when you’re not sure if a function requires an argument, or if you’re in doubt about the use of arguments such as trim.\nYou can access the help page for a given function in different ways.\nThe most efficient one is by typing a question mark and the function name in the command line. If you now press Return (Mac) / Enter (Windows), this command will also open the help page for the function. Alternatively, you can use thehelp()function in the command line, as below.\n\n?mean()\n\nhelp('mean')\n\nThen there is my preferred option (and again, when we start using the script pane, I will make this clear):\nYou can also go to the search line of the Help tab in the Files, Plots, Packages, Help pane (bottom right of the screen) and type the name of the function there (mean).
